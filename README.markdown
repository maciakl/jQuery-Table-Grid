jQuery Table Grid
===

This is an attempt to simulate Excel like grid using a HTML table in which each cell contains an input box. You can move around the grid with the arrow keys just like in excel. Moving highlights the value so that it can be overwritten.

The file grid.js contains all the JavaScript logic required for this to work. A copy of the jQuery framework is also included because it is a required dependency.

The files grid.html and grid.php are working examples. The PHP one actually generates a fairly large grid with random values. The HTML one is static.
